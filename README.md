# Instructor-Evaluation
I worked using the videos on this channel https://www.youtube.com/@dilrubakose. 
I wrote this back-end for a project at school. I did it using Java spring. 
Since we planned to test it together with the front-end, many things were missing as the front-end did not catch up. 
Of course, being my first back-end project is one of the reasons for these shortcomings.
